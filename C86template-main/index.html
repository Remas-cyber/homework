		<h2>All my life, I have searched for inspiration to deal with the troubles in life but little did I know that after all these years my steps would return to you. You are my idol, you endured bone crushing pain and brought me into this world, and you made sure I was happy even when you were facing a hard time.
			
			
			
			I still remember how you spent sleepless nights, not leaving my bedside when I was sick. I also remember how proud you were when I graduated from Elementary School. I was able to achieve this success because of your encouragement and support.
			
			Thank you, mom, for your constant support and belief in me. Your words of encouragement inspired me to work hard and achieve what seemed to be impossible.
			
			What have I done to deserve a mother like you? I thank god for making you my mother. I love you so much. 
			Love,Remas
